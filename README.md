Lucius Color Scheme for Sublime Text 3
======================================

This is a version of the
[Lucius vim color scheme](https://github.com/jonathanfilip/vim-lucius) adapted
for Sublime Text 3.

Although I try to emulate the original color scheme as good as I can,
the different parsers scope the same elements differently.
For example,
in vim function declarations in Python are coloured,
but not in C++.
SublimeLucius colors them in both Python and C++.

This project is a WIP and (hopefully) continuously improved.
I plan to incorporate all original configurations.

Patches (and pull requests) are welcome.
